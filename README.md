InstantUssd is a USSD development package meant to provide you, the developer, with a set of tools to help you easily and quickly build and maintain your own USSD applications. While the goal of this package is to remain as flexible as possible it still won't cover all situations and solve all problems.

## Goals

- Speed up USSD development
- Ease maintenance of USSD code

## Features

- Minimal coding (Provide USSD menus as config)
- Automatic screen to screen navigation
- Out of the box validation of user inputs
- Ready solutions for complex USSD flows involving going back and forth,
optional screens, looping set of screens,  jumping from screen to screen and 
resuming timed-out USSD sessions
